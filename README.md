GTFS data for Greece, a best-effort project with many hurdles.

### Data providers

Only two Greek transit agencies have provided public GTFS data 
so far (as of 2018-01-25), the Athens metropolitan transit agency 
OASA and the Greek railways (Trainose). The data is very outdated 
(OASA) and of questionable quality (Trainose).

There are dozens of other public transport providers in Greece, 
who cover big parts of the country and provide important services, 
but do not provide any open GTFS data or any data at all. The 
purpose of this project is to collect, standardise, publish and 
refine the data, with or without their cooperation.

The [original Trainose data](http://www.trainose.gr/gtfs/) are

intention of Trainose appears to be to place the data in the 
public domain, but that's only an assumption. You use that data 
at your own peril.

not all - geographic data in the patches and new additions are derived
